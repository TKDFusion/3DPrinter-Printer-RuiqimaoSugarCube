## Frame

| Part | Quantity | Link |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| SugarCube Frame | 1 | [DLLPDF](https://dllpdf.com/sugarcube-frame) |

Drawings for the frame are available at [Drawings/Frame Extrusions.pdf](Drawings/Frame%20Extrusions.pdf).

## Bed heater

> [!WARNING]
> The bed heater drawing is untested.

A bed heater drawing is available at [Drawings/Bed Heater.pdf](Drawings/Bed%20Heater.pdf), which can be used to request a custom order at [Keenovo](https://www.keenovo.com/). Alternatively, a standard 100mm x 100mm or Voron 0 bed heater can be used as well.

Heater should be AC-powered and be at least 100W.

## Toolhead

SugarCube supports toolheads with belts facing outwards and spaced 10mm from the X extrusion (standard PFA). Belts are spaced 4mm apart (non-standard PFA).

The recommended toolhead for SugarCube is [Archetype Blackbird](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Archetype). This document does not contain materials needed for the toolhead.

## Panels

| 3mm cork sheet | As needed | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFKTGZSB/) |
| Foil tape | As needed | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNSXHK5C) |
| 15mm x 2mm foam tape | As needed | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L69KY7X) |

Side and back panels should be constructed using a sandwich of 3.2mm aluminum, 3mm cork, and foil tape. This provides both insulation and sound dampening.

The front panel requires ~1.5mm-2mm of foam for sealing.
